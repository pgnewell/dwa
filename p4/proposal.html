<h1>DWA Project 4 Proposal</h1>
<h2>A Recipe builder</h2>
<h3>by Paul Newell</h3>
<p>
This site would allow a user to view a set of stored recipes and “execute” them by
pressing a button. Here execution means displaying a list of steps and allowing the user
to click them done as a recipe is being completed so that they can see what is left (see
http://p3_done.pgnewell.com). The home page would have a list of recipes made public by
their builders ranked by some formula using most liked, recent and least viewed and the
ability to log in or sign up. Logging in would lead the user to the ability to view or
build and save recipes. The user should also be able to affix photographs to the recipes.
</p>
<p>
The main page would be a divided into 3 sections with a header a sidebar and a display.
The header would be mostly decorative. The sidebar would have sign in/up and perhaps
something else. The display would have a set of recent entries.
</p>
<p>
Sign in would lead to a new page with the sidebar now having options for adding or editing
entries (recipes) or the users profile. The display would have the users recent entries or
some other display as requested by the user (depending on how much time I have to get
fancy). The user would be able to save and retrieve recipes to add, modify or delete
them.

Related sites (as for project 3):
<a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/'>Cooking for
engineers</a> Doesn't have a recipe builder but the format for
displaying recipes intrigues me. <br>
<a href='http://www.weightwatchers.com'>Weight Watchers</a> This has a
recipe builder but I haven't used it<br>
There is a place called FitClick that claims to but doesn't, so that
can be inspiring too.
