This is a microblog

I should logging in signing up, creating posts and reading the posts that others have written or all posts.

There are two added features, deleting a post that you have written and liking a post that someone else has written.

Well you can probably like your own post but I will try to stop that.

When you enter the site all posts are displayed in order of likes.

The navigation is not really clean. after liking or deleting a post it should return to the proper page but I can't get that to work yet.
