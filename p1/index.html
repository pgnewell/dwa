					<h3>About me</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="right-column">
I was born in Canada and grew up in central Mass.<br/>
I am a programmer but although I have written a few web pages I have never been comfortable with CSS or HTML.<br/>
My expertise is in finance and databases.

					<h3>Website</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="right-column">
My website is hosted by Hurricane Electric, but the package is no longer available. I will move it soon. I couldn't get git to work properly so I copied the git and unzipped it locally. I also have
<a title="Alternate web site" href="http://pgn.dyndns-remote.com/dwa/p1">pgn.dyndns-remote.com/dwa/p1</a>
 which works as expected, git and all, but is not reliable as I have been having problems with COMCAST.

					<h3>Editor</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="right-column">
I use vim as an editor. That will probably change. I am trying Komodo and will try emacs (again). I will never be happy until they port EDT (DEC) to Linux.
