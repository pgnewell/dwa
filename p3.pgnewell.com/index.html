<h1>DWA Project 3 Proposal</h1>
<h2>A Recipe builder</h2>
<h3>by Paul Newell</h3>
<p>
This project would build a recipe from a pallete of available
steps. Steps would include things like bake, stir, cool, etc. but also
mis-en-place, which would have associated elements, namely
ingredients. For each step dependencies on other steps could be
recorded. Recipes would be recorded in XML as would the information
related to the steps. You could then execute the recipe, which would
display the available steps (the ones with no or completed
dependencies) and check them as done.

engineers</a> Doesn't have a recipe builder but the format for
displaying recipes intrigues me. <br>

recipe builder but I haven't used it<br>
There is a place called FitClick that claims to but doesn't, so that
can be inspiring too.
